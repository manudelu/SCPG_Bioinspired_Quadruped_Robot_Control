Learning Algorithm

Spiking Patterns:
--------------------------------

* Walk: 

|    |t1 |t2 |t3 |t4 |
|----|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| N2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| N3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| N3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
   
* Trot:

|    |t1 |t2 |
|----|---|---|
| N1 | 1 | 0 | 
| N2 | 0 | 1 | 
| N3 | 1 | 0 |
| N3 | 0 | 1 | 

* Bound:

|    |t1 |t2 |
|----|---|---|
| N1 | 1 | 0 | 
| N2 | 1 | 0 | 
| N3 | 0 | 1 |
| N3 | 0 | 1 | 
 
* Diagonal Walk:

|    |t1 |t2 |t3 |t4 |
|----|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| N2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| N3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| N3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

* Gallop: 

|    |t1 |t2 |t3 |t4 |
|----|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| N2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| N3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| N3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Each gait sequence (Walk, Trot, Bound, Diagonal Walk and Gallop) must be repeated more than once during the learning process, otherwise you'll get a network that cannot stably reproduce gait. So we set a number of repetitions: ```reps = 10```.

Remark: 

* N_i = Neurons
* t_i = Time Instances

The SCPG network is composed of four fully connected neurons that generate gait pattern with spikes. Each neuron corresponds to one leg and spikes to activate the servo motor of the corresponding leg that finally actuates the leg. A sequence of spikes generated by the SCPG network can drive the locomotion of the quadruped robot. Such a sequence determines the gait pattern that controls the speed and direction of locomotion. The CPG neurons are driven by input neurons called gait selection neurons. We use five gait selection neurons to enable five different gaits. When a gait pattern is desired, one gait selection neuron stimulates a subset of CPG neurons to fire in a particular sequence and enable a designed locomotion gait. All the CPG neurons are connected to gait selection neurons with excitatory synapses. To emulate the dynamics of each neuron, we use a discretized leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model with membrane potential (Vj) expressed as:
