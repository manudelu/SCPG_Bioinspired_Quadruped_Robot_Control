Goals:

* Avoid trajectories that would penetrate the ground (avoid high ground reaction forces - GRF);
* Avoid weak contact or loss of contact (avoid slippage);
* Avoid undesired leg internal forces (avoid slippage and waste of energy);
* Reduce disturbances between joint position and trunk attitude controllers;
* Reduce disturbances at the trunk due to poor state estimation (avoid excessive GRF);
* Increase the locomotion robustness with respect to unexpected terrain irregularities (avoid excessive GRF).
