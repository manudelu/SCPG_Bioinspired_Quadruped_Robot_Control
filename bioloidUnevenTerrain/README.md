Motion Generation
-------------------

The purpose of this part of the framework is to generate stereotypic and reactive motions for the feet. We will use a CPG-inspired trajectory generator that provides elliptical trajectories for the feet, which dynamically adapt to the terrain profile.


Ellipse-shaped trajectories are generated by a network of four non-linear oscillators, whose state represents the Cartesian coordinates of each foot. We add non-linear filters coupled to the output of the network of oscillators. During each leg's swing phase the filter output tracks the output of its corresponding oscillator. The filters also receive information about the foot contact on the ground, allowing them to adapt the trajectories according to the actual terrain profile. This is achieved by cutting the ellipses, as explained later. The shape of the adapted trajectories are illustrated in the following image on the right.
